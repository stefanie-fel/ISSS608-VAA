# Background

background of what I'm doing and objective of the analysis

A local online media company that publishes daily content on digital platforms is planning to release an article on **demographic structures and distribution of Singapore in 2024**.

Assuming the role of the graphical editor of the media company, you are tasked to prepare **at most three data visualisation** for the article.

# The Data

The dataset was extracted from <a href = https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data>Singstat</a> under the name <b>Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024</b>.

![](images/screenshot_dataset.png)

It comprised of 6 variables and 60K records. The dataset recorded the demographics and count of residents who lived in each sub zone and planning area in June 2024.

# Load Required Libraries

```{r}
pacman::p_load(dplyr, tidyverse)
```

# Import Data

```{r, message=TRUE}
population_data <- read_csv("respopagesex2024.csv")
```

As can be seen above, the data set comprise of 6 variables: 4 variables are character data type (namely, PA, SZ, age and sex), and 2 variables are double data type (number of population, time). Here is the a snippet of the data set:

```{r}
head(population_data)
```

# Data pre-processing

First, we will look if there are duplicates found in the data set.

```{r}
nrow(population_data[duplicated(population_data), ])
```

Next, we will check for missing values in the data set.

```{r}
sapply(population_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

Now, that let's convert the age data type from character data type to integer data type.

\
We first check for unique values in the Age variable.

```{r}
unique(population_data$Age)
```

We can't change the variable to numeric data type because we have values "90_and_Over". So we can change it to age 90 and change the data type.

```{r}
population_data$Age[population_data$Age == "90_and_Over"] <- "90"
typeof(population_data$Age) 
population_data$Age <- as.numeric(population_data$Age)
```

```{r}
unique(population_data$Sex)

```

```{r}
population_data$Sex[population_data$Sex == "Female"] <- "1"
population_data$Sex[population_data$Sex == "Male"] <- "0"
population_data$Sex <- as.numeric(population_data$Sex)
```

Univariate

```{r}
ggplot(data = population_data, aes(x = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(color = "grey30", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(y = "Count", title = "Count of Records by Sex")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=population_data, 
       aes(x = Age, fill="darkslategray1")) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="gray30")  
```

Variable Selection

Age and Gender Distribution of Singapore Residents

```{r}
population_data %>%
  mutate(population = ifelse(Sex == 0, Pop * (-1), Pop * 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = population, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Age-Sex Pyramid", x = "Age", y = "Population")
```
