## Getting Started

Objective of this exercise:

-   How to model, analyze and visualize network

-   create graph object data frame, manipulate them using dplyr, lubridate and tidygraph

-   build network graph visualization using appropriate function of ggraph

-   compute network geometrics using tidygraph

-   build advanced graph visualization by adding network geometrics

-   Build interactive network visualization using visNetwork

## Import Libraries

```{r}
pacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, 
               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,
               tidyverse, graphlayouts, 
               concaveman, ggforce)
```

The libraries used in this exercise would be:

-   igraph: provides function for generating random and regular graphs, graph visualization, centrality methods, etc

-   tidygraph: an entry unto the tidyverse that provides a tidy framework for all things relational (network, graph, trees, etc)

-   ggraph

-   visNetwork: package for network visualization using vis.js (a JS library)

-   lubridate: makes it easier working with dates and times

-   clock: R package to work with date-times

-   tidyverse

-   graphlayouts: additional layout algorithm for network visualization

-   concaveman: the *concavemean* function ports *concaveman* library from *mapbox* and computes the concave polygon for one or several set of points.

-   ggforce: provide missing functionality *ggplot2* through extension introduced with *ggplotv2*

## Import Data

In thsi exercise, we'll be using two dataset, the node data and the link data. The datasets are from oil exploration and extraction company. The edge dataset contain two weeks of 9063 emails correspondence between 55 employees, whereas the nodes dataset consist of names, department and title of employees.

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- read_csv("GAStech_email_node.csv")
GAStech_edges <- read_csv("GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv")
```

## Review Data

Next, we checl for the structure of the data frame using glimpse() to show us a snippet of the values in each columns.

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

## Data Wrangling

As seen above, the sentDate variable is in character data type instead of date data type. So we want to change the data type.

```{r}
GAStech_edges <- GAStech_edges %>%
  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %>%
  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,
                        label = TRUE,
                        abbr = FALSE))
```

::: callout-note
-   `dmy` and `wday` functions are from the lubidate package

-   `dmy` transform SentDate to date data type

-   `wday` the day of the week as decimal number if label is TRUE, but returns name of the day if label is FALSE. This function create a new column in the data frame.
:::

Next, we will check the make sure the created variable has the right data type and data.

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

However, since the data frame reveals that it consist of individual e-mail flow record, it may not be useful for visualization. So we want to aggregate the individual by date sent, senders, receiver, main subject and day of the week.

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>%
    summarise(Weight = n()) %>%
  filter(source!=target) %>%
  filter(Weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

::: callout-note
-   `filter(MainSubject == "Work related")` filters and keep rows that is work related and group them by `source`, `target` and `weekday`

-   `summarise(Weight = n())` takes each unique group and count number of rows there is and assign them to `Weight`

-   `filter(source != target)` removes rows where source and target are the same person, while `filter(Weight > 1)` only keeps interaction that happened more than once on the same weekday

-   `ungroup()` removes the grouping
:::

Time to check the `GAStech_edges_aggregated` dataframe.

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

## Create network object with tidygraph

tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, such as:

-   `tbl_graph` : creates a tbl_graph network from nodes and edges data

-   `as_tbl_graph()` : convert network data and object into tbl_graph network. The following are the network data and object supported by this function:

    -   a **node** **data.frame** and an **edge** data.frame

    -   **data.frame, list, matrix** from base

    -   **igraph** from igraph

    -   **network** from network

    -   **dendrogram** and **hclust** from **stats**

    -   **Node** from data.tree

    -   **phylo** and **evonet** from ape

    -   **graphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM** from graph (in Bioconductor)

### Using tbl_graph() to build data model

Create `tbl_graph` of tinygraph to build tidygraph's network graph datafarme

```{r}
GAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,
                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, 
                           directed = TRUE)
```

```{r}
GAStech_graph
```

::: callout-note
-   The tbl_graph consist of 54 nodes and 1372 edges

-   The Node data is active, this means that it's possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time
:::

Change the active object

The nodes in the tibble data frame is active by default, but we can **change which tibble data frame is active** with the **activate() function.** If we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list with highest weight, we can use **activate()** and **arrange()**.

```{r}
GAStech_graph %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  arrange(desc(Weight))
```

Plot Static Network Graph with ggraph

There are 3 main ascept to ggrpah's network graph, such as:

-   nodes

-   edges

-   layouts: vertical and horizontal placement fo nodes when plotting particular graph structure

    In this example, we'll use geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network using GAStech_graph

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point()
```

## Customize the Style of Graph

### Using Theme

In this example, we can use theme to remove x and y-axes by using `theme_graph()` .

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

But apart from that, we can also use `theme_graph()` to remove grids, border or font. Additionally, we can also change the color of the plot by adding `colour =` argument like below:

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))

g + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',
                text_colour = 'white')
```

### ggraph Layout

ggraph supports different standard layouts such as star, circle, nicelt (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. The below shows layouts supported by ggraph.

![](images/ggraph_layout1.png)

![](images/ggraph_layout3.png)

Fruchterman and Reingold Layout

In this example, we'll be creating network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout (done by adding `layout = "fr"` in argument in ggraph)

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

## Modify Network Node

In this example, we'll color the node by their departments.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                      size = 3))

g + theme_graph()
```

::: callout-tip
-   We added `colour = Department` in`geom_node_point(aes())`
:::

## Modify Network Edges

In this example, we'll change the thickness of the edges by adding Weights.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 3)

g + theme_graph()
```

::: callout-tip
-   Similar to modifying the network node, we can add arguments into the `geom_edge_link()` to add weights to the edges.
:::

## Creating facet graphs

In data visualization, facet is used to reduce edge over-plotting by **spreading nodes** **and edges** out **based on their attributes**. There are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting:

-   `facet_nodes()`: edges are only drawn in panel if **both terminal are present**

-   `facet_edges()`: nodes are always drawn in all panels even if node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for edge facetting

-   `facet_graph()`: faceting on two variables **simultaneously**

### Working with facet_edges()

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)

g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

We also can change the position of the legend like below:

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
  
g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

Additionally, we can also frame each graph like below:

```{r}
set_graph_style() 

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)
  
g + facet_edges(~Weekday) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

## Working with facet_nodes()

In this example, we used facet_nodes()

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)
  
g + facet_nodes(~Department)+
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

## Network Metric Analysis

### Computing Centrality Indices

Centrality measures are collection of statistical indices used to describe relative importance of the actors are to a network. There are 4 types of cenrality measures:

-   Degree: how many connection a node has

-   Betweenness: centrality measure of vertex within a graph (high betweenness = bridge or bottleneck in a network or have shortest path to reach the other node)

-   Closeness: vertices that have shorter distance to other vertices have higher closeness (shortest path has higher centrality)

-   Eigenvector: measure of the importance of a node in a network (the value of your connection affects your own value)

    In this example, we'll be usig the betweeness centrality.

    ```{r}
    g <- GAStech_graph %>%
      mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
      ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
      geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                     alpha=0.2) +
      scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
      geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,
                size=betweenness_centrality))
    g + theme_graph()
    ```

## Visualizing Network Metrics

From **ggraph v2.0** onward tidygraph algorithms, such as centrality measures can be accessed directly in ggraph calls, so it's no longer necessary to precompute and store derived node and edge centrality measures.

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                      size = centrality_betweenness()))
g + theme_graph()
```

## Visualizing Community

tidygraph package inherit many community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph and it is made available to us, incl. *edge-betweenness (group_edge_betweenness)*, *Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen)*, *Fast-greedy (group_fast_greedy)*, *Louvain (group_louvain)*, *Walktrap (group_walktrap)*, *Label propagation (group_label_prop)*, *InfoMAP (group_infomap)*, *Spinglass (group_spinglass)*, and *Optimal (group_optimal)*. In this example, the group_edge_betweenness().

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(
    group_edge_betweenness(
      weights = Weight, 
      directed = TRUE))) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(
    aes(
      width=Weight), 
    alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(
    range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(
    aes(colour = community))  

g + theme_graph()
```

To support effective visual investigation the community network has been revised by using `geom_mark_hull()` of ggforce.

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(
    group_optimal(weights = Weight)),
         betweenness_measure = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_mark_hull(
    aes(x, y, 
        group = community, 
        fill = community),  
    alpha = 0.2,  
    expand = unit(0.3, "cm"),  # Expand
    radius = unit(0.3, "cm")  # Smoothness
  ) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = Department,
                      size = betweenness_measure),
                      color = "black",
                      shape = 21)
  
g + theme_graph()
```

## Build Interactive Network Graph using visNetwork

visNetwork() function uses a nodes list and edges list and create interactive graph. But nodes list must include an "id" column and the edge list must have "from" and "to" column. The function also pots the label for the nodes, using the names of the actors from "label" column.

### Data Prep Steps

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("sourceLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(from = id) %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("targetLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(to = id) %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
    summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  filter(from!=to) %>%
  filter(weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

::: callout-note
-   `left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("sourceLabel" = "label"))`match email's sender to their id in the node table and `rename(from = id)` add column id and renamed it to from

-   `filter(MainSubject == "Work related")` filters out emails that are not work-related

-   `group_by(from, to) %>% summarise(weight = n())` count how many emails were sent fro each sender-reciever

-   `filter(weight > 1)` keeps only relationship of people who emailed each other more than once
:::

### Create Interactive Network Graph

Now, we plot the graph.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, 
 GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

In this example, we'll use Fruchterman and Reingold layout.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") 
```

## Working with Visual Attributes (Nodes)

In this example, we want to group the data based on department, wich visNetwork looks for "field" in node object and color the node according to the value in the group field. In this example, we'll change the Department field to group.

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- GAStech_nodes %>%
  rename(group = Department) 
```

Then visNetwork shades the node by assigning unique color to each category in group field.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

## Working with Visual Attributes (Edges)

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visEdges(arrows = "to", 
           smooth = list(enabled = TRUE, 
                         type = "curvedCW")) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

::: {.callout-note title="What the code does"}
-   `visEdges()` is used to symbolize the edges

-   `arrows` is used to define where to place the arrow

-   `smooth` is used to plot the edges using a smooth curve
:::

## Interactivity

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE,
             nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

::: {.callout-note title="What the code does"}
-   `visoptions()` is used to symbolize the edges

-   `highlightNearest` highlight nearest when clicking a node

-   `nodesIdSelection` adds an id node selection by creating HTML select element
