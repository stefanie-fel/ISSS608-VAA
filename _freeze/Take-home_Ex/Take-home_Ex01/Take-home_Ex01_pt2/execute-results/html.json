Background\n\nObjective of this exercise:\n\n-   Review a classmate's Take-home Exercise 1 in which I chose to review `<a href=\"`{=html}<https://isss-608-yihao-yuan.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01/take-home_ex01>`\">`{=html}Yuan Yihao</a>'s work\n\n-   Critique the good design principles used in their visualization\n\n-   Create makeover version of chosen visualization\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    :::\n\n\n\n# Good Design Principles Used in Visualization\n\nThe 3 visualization he created are the following:\n\nPopulation by Age and Sex\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_pt2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPopulation by Age Group and Planning Area (Analyze the Aging Population in Each Region)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_pt2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAging-to-Under-Age Population Ratio by Planning Area\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(age_ratio, aes(x = ratio, y = reorder(PA, ratio))) + geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + labs( title = \"Aging-to-Under-Age Population Ratio by Planning Area\", x = \"Aging / Under Age Ratio\", y = \"Planning Area\" ) + theme_minimal() + theme( axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5), plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_pt2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nDesign principles implemented:\n\n-   Each graph has good color schemes, the colors between genders contrast each other that it's easy to distinguish between genders\n\n-   The usage of muted color in the Population by Age and Sex chart is helpful to highlight distribution of sex within the population\n\n-   The graph is clearly labeled in the x-axis, y-axis, title and legend - good explanation (legends) to help reader understand the context of the graph\n\n# Makeover Version of Chosen Visualization\n\n## Import Libraries for Makeover\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Makeover Version of Population by Age Group and Planning Area (Analyze the Aging Population in Each Region)\n\nThe graph is supposed to compare the number of population between genders and age (e.g. the number female is greater than male at the age 50, then the number of female population will be subtracted by the male population and a bar chart will be plotted). However, if we look at the graph at a glance, it might look like the distribution of the population between genders based on age instead.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrouped_data <- res_data %>%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\ngrouped_data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 182 × 3\n     Age Sex       Pop\n   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1     0 Females 14370\n 2     0 Males   15090\n 3     1 Females 15580\n 4     1 Males   16700\n 5     2 Females 17190\n 6     2 Males   17980\n 7     3 Females 17340\n 8     3 Males   18200\n 9     4 Females 19070\n10     4 Males   19880\n# ℹ 172 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
