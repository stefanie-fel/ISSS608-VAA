The essential arguments are: numerator (event of interest), denominator (population to be considered) and group. The package has the following arguments that can be customized:\n\nlimit : specifies confidence limits for funnel plot (95 or 99)\nlabel_outliers : label outliers (true or false)\nPoisson_limits : add poisson limit to the plot\nOD_adjust : add overdispersed limit to the plot, which inflates the control limits\nxrange and yrange : specify range to display for each axes\nAesthetic component\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a funnel plot ?\n\n\n\n\nWhen we visualize uncertainty, we’ll always be dealing with variation (dealing with multiple occurrences and determine what and how they differ)\nTwo types of variation:\n\nNoise: they are completely random (unknown reasons)\nSignal: they are not totally random and can point to underlying causes that can be insightful (to improve)\n\nThis is where funnel plot comes in! Funnel plot can help us to determine if a data point is noise or signal\n\n\n\n\n\nFunnel Plot using FunnelPlotR\nThe example uses creates funnel plot grouped by sub-district and uses standardized ratio (comapre observed performance agaianst expected) as default plot type.\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,\n  numerator = Positive,\n  denominator = Death,\n  group = `Sub-district`\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 0 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\nFunnelPlotR Makeover\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,\n  numerator = Death,\n  denominator = Positive,\n  group = `Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",   \n  x_range = c(0, 6500),  \n  y_range = c(0, 0.05),   \n  label = NA,\n  title = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases\",          \n  x_label = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases\",\n  y_label = \"Cumulative Fatality Rate\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this code do\n\n\n\n\ndata_type = \"PR\" : refers to plotting a proportion ratio plot (used to visualize proportion of percentage of events to compare how different groups perform compared o percentage fo events)\nx_range : sets range of value for x-axis\ny_range : sets range of value for y-axis\nlabel = NA : used to remove default label outliers feature\n\n\n\n\n\nFunnel Plot using ggplot2\nIn this example, we want to create funnel plot that plots the cumulative fatality rate by cumulative number of cases.\nFirst, we derive the cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.\n\ndf &lt;- covid19 %&gt;%\n  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %&gt;%\n  filter(rate &gt; 0)\n\nThen we compute the weighted mean.\n\nfit.mean &lt;- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)\n\nNext, we compute the lower and upper limit for 95% and 99% CI\n\nnumber.seq &lt;- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)\nnumber.ll95 &lt;- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul95 &lt;- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ll999 &lt;- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul999 &lt;- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \ndfCI &lt;- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, \n                   number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)\n\nNow, we can plot the funnel plot\n\np &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +\n  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), \n             alpha=0.4) +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_hline(data = dfCI, \n             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), \n             size = 0.4, \n             colour = \"grey40\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = \"95%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = \"99%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") +\n  xlab(\"Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") + \n  ylab(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),\n        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), \n        legend.title = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.text = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.background = element_rect(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"cm\"))\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Interactive Funnel Plot using plotly and ggplot2\nWe can make the plot above interactive by using ggplotly()\n\nfp_ggplotly &lt;- ggplotly(p,\n  tooltip = c(\"label\", \n              \"x\", \n              \"y\"))\nfp_ggplotly"

    "section": "3.2 Makeover Version of Population by Population by Age and Sex",
    "text": "3.2 Makeover Version of Population by Population by Age and Sex\nThe graph is supposed to compare the number of population between genders and age (e.g. the number female is greater than male at the age 50, then the number of female population will be subtracted by the male population and a bar chart will be plotted). However, if we look at the graph at a glance, it might look like a distribution of the population between genders based on age chart instead.\nMy approach to the makeover:\n\nChange the chart type from bar chart to stacked bar chart. Though we could easily understand the which gender population is much more prominent in each age, but it isn’t straight-forward. Since we want to compare the number of population between gender and age and which gender is more dominant in each age, stacked bar chart might be a better approach to compare between gender.\nChange the y-axis from count of population to percentage since the focus of the graph is to compare and show difference between genders. Additionally, percentage makes the difference much more visible and easier to compare than raw values.\nUse similar idea of “fading content that is not relevant” by fading the gender that has lower percentage.\n\n\ngrouped_data &lt;- res_data %&gt;% # group population based on age and sex\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent = Pop / sum(Pop) * 100, # convert count into percentage\n         is_dominant = Pop == max(Pop))  # flags if gender has higher number\n\n\nggplot(grouped_data, aes(x = Age, y = Percent, fill = Sex, alpha = is_dominant, # transparency for gender that has lower percentage\n                         width=0.6)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") + # visualize stacked bar chart\n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = 1, \"FALSE\" = 0.4), guide = \"none\") +  labs(\n    title = \"Age-Sex Population Structure (in Percentage)\",\n    x = \"Age\",\n    y = \"Percentage (%)\"\n  )  +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInisght\n\n\n\n\nThe population have roughly similar number of male and female population from age 0 - 27. However, the male population is still slightly higher in number than female.\nFrom age 28 above, the population is dominated by female. The trend seems go higher as the age increases."

We'll be delivering equipment at 0600 tomorrow via eastern reef route. What installation challenges are you facing that might affect our 5-day deadline?\n\n\n\n\nMonday, October 08 2040, 11:14\nSentinel, Mako here. Your allegations are unfounded. We're operating under permit #CR-7844, not NR-1045. Our transponder issues were genuine technical problems, now resolved. We're conducting authorized marine research equipment transport, nothing more.\n\n\n\n\nMonday, October 08 2040, 11:21\nNadia, Davis here. I'll be at the marina office at 7PM with all shipping manifests. Could you bring copies of permit #CR-7844? Marlin's asking about unusual vessel routes near eastern shoals - might need to address this.\n\n\n\n\nMonday, October 08 2040, 11:28\nRodriguez, Davis here. Continue with Mako at Nemo Reef. We're operating under permit #CR-7844, meeting with Nadia tonight to finalize documentation. No need for alternative site preparations at this time. Keep operations discreet.\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, October 09 2040, 11:53\nV. Miesel, Mako here. Requesting authorization for extended night operations to meet accelerated timeline. Need additional crew rotation approval for 24-hour operations over next 5 days. Permit #CR-7844 activities require increased tempo.\n\n\n\n\nThursday, October 11 2040, 09:57\nV. Miesel HQ to Neptune. Understood your urgent staffing concerns. We're authorizing immediate priority for critical path elements involving permit #CR-7844. Redirect 30% of Remora's crew to support your operations.

Council pressure increasing after EcoVigil approval. Redirected them north, but Boss needs southwest cleared immediately. Bring extra encryption - we'll need it.\n\n\n\n\nFriday, October 12 2040, 09:54\nV. Miesel HQ to Neptune. Secondary communication channel authorized. Use encryption protocol Delta-3 for sensitive transmissions. Continue heightened security measures. Keep us informed of any conservation vessel activity near your position.\n\n\n\n\nFriday, October 12 2040, 09:55\nNeptune to Remora. All logistics confirmed for tomorrow's operation.

Miesel is involved in the operation as some of its personnel are integrated in the operation\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Conclusion from the timeline:\n\nNadia Conti was working together with V. Miesel to create special permits that as intended, she created permit for operations that is illegal\nThere is also bribery done by Nadia as she told Liam that she needed his services to ensure that Harbor Master remains “cooperative” through next week and investigation on Nemo Reef permits were brewing.\n\nAlthough, there was no evidence apart from her exchanges that she was directly involved in the illegal activities. It seemed like she worked behind the scene in getting the permit and authorizing operations, thus justifying Clepper’s suspicions."

The weather looks perfect for spotting those migratory species! The Lookout here! Those sea turtles were pretty close to shore, maybe 50 yards out from Nemo Reef. Unusual to see them so close! Don't forget your sunscreen tomorrow - forecast says it'll be bright. See you at Sunrise Point! The Lookout here! Something odd at Nemo Reef - just spotted the Mako vessel approaching the protected area with conservation boats following them. Didn't they mention this was off-limits? Still on for birdwatching tomorrow? I've packed extra snacks! Hey Kelly, it's Sam. This permit approval seems fishy. Could you get details on who signed off on it while you're at the harbor? I need to understand these 'special access corridors' before my meeting with Elise tomorrow. The Lookout here! Just saw the harbor master posting notices about equipment deliveries to Nemo Reef tomorrow. Several large crates marked 'fragile' being prepared. Seems like Neptune vessel is scheduled for arrival. Still on for birdwatching at 7 AM? Hey Sam, it's Kelly! Got some photos of those crates - definitely marked 'fragile' and 'handle with care.' Neptune's crew is being super secretive. They're using special loading equipment I've never seen before. See you at 7 for birdwatching! The Lookout here! Yes, our usual spot works perfect. Bring underwater camera if you have one - I've got extra waterproof bags. The conservation vessels mentioned setting up remote monitoring stations around the reef perimeter. See you at 7! The Lookout here! Those conservation vessels are still active - they're now filing formal protests against the reef closure. Saw them collecting water samples as evidence. Perfect day for osprey watching though! Still on for tomorrow's birdwatching session? The Lookout here! Just spotted a pod of dolphins near the reef this morning - absolutely incredible! The conservation vessels are still monitoring, but the wildlife seems undisturbed. Are we still meeting for birdwatching tomorrow? Heard there might be some rare shearwaters passing through. The Lookout here! Conservation vessels have increased activity - they're deploying underwater microphones around Nemo Reef now. Perfect conditions for our birdwatching tomorrow though! I've spotted three different osprey families near our usual spot.

Marlin's asking about unusual vessel routes near eastern shoals - might need to address this. Marlin, Nadia here. I understand you're inquiring about eastern shoal routes. Those are temporary diversions due to equipment transport needs. I'll have Davis provide the necessary documentation tonight. Nothing to be concerned about. Davis, Marlin here again. Nadia mentioned you'd provide documentation about those eastern shoal diversions tonight. Just checking if that's still coming through. Need to understand these new patterns while my vessel's being repaired. Nadia, Elise here. Situation escalating. Permanent underwater construction confirmed at Nemo Reef. Sam reports concrete forms suggesting structures beyond equipment installation. Need urgent clarification on real scope and V. Miesel's involvement before tomorrow's meeting. Prepare contingencies. Nadia, Sentinel here. Have you received any scientific data supporting the Nemo Reef closure? Our water quality tests show normal parameters. City Council claims reports are with Maritime Authority, but I suspect potential ulterior motives. Nadia, Elise here. Meeting confirmed for 0500 at Nemo Reef. Sam's evidence shows clear V. Miesel connection to permanent structures. Conservation vessels increasing surveillance - could complicate our operation. Bring alternate financial channels in case we need quick adaptation. Nadia, Liam here. EcoVigil is questioning the ROV delay. I've redirected them to the northern quadrant, but they're suspicious about the southwest. We need to clean up operations there immediately. What's our contingency plan? Liam, Nadia here. Redirect all remaining operations from southwest immediately. Move equipment to our secondary location. I'll handle EcoVigil through proper channels. Meet me at the usual place at 2100 hours with updated documentation. Rodriguez, Davis here. Maintain current position with Mako at Nemo Reef. Security team arriving at 0600.

The City Council has concerns about Nemo Reef's northwest section due to heightened protection status. I'm meeting with them tomorrow to discuss alternatives. Will update you after the meeting. Hello Sailor Shifts Team, Samantha Blake here. I've been researching alternative locations with similar aesthetics to Nemo Reef. Could you provide your secondary location preferences before my meeting with the City Council tomorrow? Samantha, Mako here. We're ready to depart Himark with your coordination team. Crew's surprised by the rapid approvals - seems the Boss knows the right people. Need confirmation on your schedule: today for site prep, tomorrow for equipment installation, and event execution in a week? Mako, this is Samantha Blake. I'm confused by your message - I haven't secured any approvals yet and have no coordination team traveling. I'm actually facing permit challenges with the City Council regarding Nemo Reef's protected status. Samantha, Mako here. On course with equipment transport schedule. Need confirmation on final delivery requirements to meet your 5-day deadline. Currently coordinating with Remora on installation logistics. Will increased night operations be necessary? Mako, Samantha Blake here. There seems to be a serious misunderstanding. I have NO approved permits, NO coordination team, and certainly NO 5-day deadline. All operations at Nemo Reef would be illegal without proper authorization, which I'm still working to obtain. Hello Oceanus City Council, this is Samantha Blake. I'm confirming our meeting tomorrow regarding the Nemo Reef filming permit. I've prepared alternative location proposals to discuss given the heightened protection status. What time should I arrive? Samantha, Mako here. Paackland Harbor just confirmed Nemo Reef closes tomorrow at 0600 for 3 days. Need guidance on how this affects our operation timeline. Should we accelerate extraction or pause activities? Samantha, Mako here. We need your confirmation on how to proceed with Nemo Reef closure. Remora requesting accelerated schedule to meet Neptune's 5-day deadline. Awaiting your decision on whether to proceed at increased tempo or adjust plans. Hello Oceanus City Council, this is Samantha Blake. I've just heard Nemo Reef is closing tomorrow at 0600. Can you confirm if this is accurate and how it affects our permit application discussion scheduled for tomorrow? Ms. Blake, Oceanus City Council here. Yes, Nemo Reef closes at 0600 tomorrow. Your permit meeting is still scheduled for 2:00 PM. Please bring your alternative location proposals as the closure will impact your original application. Mako, Samantha Blake here. Please STOP all operations immediately. I have no approved permits for Nemo Reef and any activities there would be illegal.

I've been observing unusual activity at Nemo Reef. Multiple vessels circling the protected area and someone was filing permits at city hall. Should I continue surveillance or return with my findings? Miranda, this is Clepper. Stay on surveillance at Nemo Reef. Document all vessel activities and get photos if possible. Also, find out who's filing those permits and what they're requesting specifically. This could be our next big story. Mr. Jensen, Miranda reporting in. I've identified three vessels repeatedly circling Nemo Reef - two commercial and one private yacht. The permit application was filed by someone named Rodriguez from 'Sailor Shifts Team' requesting access for 'environmental sampling.' Continuing surveillance as instructed. Miranda, Clepper here. Great work identifying those vessels. I need you to dig deeper on this Rodriguez character and the 'Sailor Shifts Team.' Get photos of their activities and any documentation of their sampling methods. This environmental angle seems suspicious. Miranda, Clepper here. Follow the money trail on Rodriguez. Check if 'environmental sampling' permits have been filed before by this group. Get closer images of their equipment and try to identify what specific minerals they might be prospecting for. This could be major environmental exploitation. Mr. Jensen, Miranda reporting. I've accessed public records on Rodriguez - he's connected to a mining consortium with previous violations in protected areas. Their equipment appears designed for core sampling, not environmental research. I've documented everything and am continuing surveillance. Miranda, Clepper here. Get closer to their sampling operation - I need to know exactly what they're extracting. Also, check if Rodriguez has political connections shielding these activities. This story could expose major environmental crimes. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. The council member meeting Rodriguez is Councilor Knowles - they exchanged documents in a private marina meeting. I've also identified their vessel as registered to V. Miesel Shipping, potentially a shell company. Awaiting further instructions. Miranda, Clepper here. Excellent work on Rodriguez and Knowles. Focus on that council connection - I need evidence of what documents they exchanged. Also, investigate V. Miesel Shipping's corporate structure. We're close to exposing this conspiracy. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've traced V. Miesel Shipping to an offshore account linked to Councilor Knowles' brother-in-law. Their equipment is designed for rare earth extraction specifically. I've documented the exchange - they're planning another meeting tomorrow at dawn. Miranda, Clepper here. Stake out that dawn meeting between Rodriguez and Knowles. Document everything with high-resolution photos. This connection between V. Miesel, rare earth mining, and a council member is exactly the corruption exposé we need. Be careful. Mr. Jensen, Miranda reporting from the stakeout. Rodriguez and Knowles just met - they exchanged documents with mining site coordinates and what appears to be permit approval signatures. I've photographed everything, including Knowles accepting an envelope that looked like cash. Miranda, Clepper here. You've hit the jackpot! That cash exchange is exactly what we needed. Stay on site if possible and track where Rodriguez goes next. This is shaping up to be a major corruption scandal involving protected marine areas. Miranda, Clepper here. Yes, get closer documentation of the equipment loading, but maintain safe distance. This connection between council approval and V. Miesel operations is our smoking gun. Photograph equipment serial numbers if possible. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've positioned closer to the V. Miesel equipment loading. They're transferring specialized drilling machinery with deep-sea modifications. I've documented serial numbers and spotted what appears to be unauthorized marine survey equipment. Awaiting further instructions. Miranda, Clepper here. Outstanding work documenting the equipment! I need you to follow that vessel's departure schedule. Monitor harbor communications and get photos of any officials authorizing this operation. This is exactly the environmental crime we suspected. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. The vessel is scheduled to depart tomorrow at 0500 hours. I've photographed harbor officials signing special clearance documents and overheard them discussing a 'priority corridor' to Nemo Reef. Will continue monitoring overnight. Miranda, Clepper here. Set up surveillance equipment for overnight monitoring of that vessel. I want continuous documentation of all personnel and activity. Rest in shifts if needed. This expedition to Nemo Reef could be the final piece of our investigation. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've intercepted conversations between harbor officials about special permits for tomorrow's expedition. They mentioned bypassing environmental review protocols and 'keeping environmentalists in the dark.' Will continue monitoring overnight. Miranda, Clepper here. Your intelligence about bypassing environmental protocols is crucial. I'm contacting our legal team tonight. Keep documenting everything - equipment, personnel, conversations. This is shaping up to be our biggest environmental crime exposé yet. Miranda, Clepper here. I've been reviewing your findings. The unauthorized drilling equipment and bypassed environmental protocols are exactly what we need. Tomorrow's 5AM departure is critical - be in position early with telephoto lens equipment. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. Vessel activity has increased overnight. They've loaded what appears to be specialized deep-sea drilling equipment with restricted classification markings. Harbor security has doubled and they're checking IDs of anyone approaching the docks. Miranda, Clepper here. The increased security and restricted equipment confirms our suspicions. Document everything - especially those classification markings. Try to capture any conversations about Nemo Reef operations. This story is bigger than we thought. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've documented a new development - Neptune vessel arrived with what appears to be specialized submersible equipment. They're coordinating with the primary vessel crew, mentioning 'extraction points' at Nemo Reef. Security protocols have intensified further. Miranda, Clepper here. This Neptune arrival is significant. Document all submersible equipment transfers and capture any mention of 'extraction points.' These specialized vessels converging suggests major unauthorized operations. Keep monitoring and stay undetected. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. New development - I've observed conservation vessels 'Reef Guardian' and 'EcoVigil' increasing patrols near the harbor. They appear to be documenting the Neptune vessel and equipment transfers. Potential allies or monitoring presence? Miranda, Clepper here. Interesting development with conservation vessels. These could be valuable allies - approach them carefully if possible. Document any interaction between them and Neptune crew. This could reveal whether environmental authorities are aware of the operation. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've observed direct communication between conservation vessels and harbor security. They're exchanging documents and photographing equipment. Conservation teams appear to have official clearance documents I couldn't see clearly. Should I attempt closer surveillance? Miranda, Clepper here. Your observation about conservation vessels and harbor security is concerning. Do NOT approach them directly - too risky. Instead, use telephoto equipment to document their document exchange. This confirms official involvement we need to expose. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've managed to photograph the classification markings on the equipment - they're labeled 'Project Poseidon: Resource Extraction Phase'. The conservation vessels appear to be conducting legitimate environmental surveys, but they're being restricted from certain areas. Miranda, Clepper here. 'Project Poseidon: Resource Extraction Phase' is our smoking gun. Conservation vessels conducting legitimate surveys while being restricted confirms our theory. This is resource exploitation disguised as security measures. Continue documenting restricted zones. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've identified a pattern - conservation vessels are being systematically blocked from areas where 'Project Poseidon' equipment is deployed. Harbor security personnel are using falsified environmental clearance documents to justify restrictions. Miranda, Clepper here. Your discovery about falsified documents is crucial evidence. Focus now on identifying which officials are authorizing these restrictions. Look for signature patterns and document all security personnel involved. This could expose the entire operation chain. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've noted conservation vessels are documenting the falsified clearance documents. They seem unaware of their fraudulent nature. Should I attempt to anonymously alert them about Project Poseidon's true purpose? Miranda, Clepper here. No, don't alert conservation vessels yet - we need more evidence first. Their documentation of falsified clearances is valuable. Instead, track which officials are signing off on these restrictions. This creates plausible deniability for higher-ups we need to identify. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've observed harbor security personnel receiving directives from someone with 'Oceanus City Council' credentials. They're systematically updating restricted zone parameters after each conservation vessel report. This suggests council-level involvement in the cover-up. Miranda, Clepper here. Council-level involvement confirms our suspicions. Follow the paper trail between these officials and Project Poseidon. Document meeting times, locations, and any financial transactions. We're getting close to exposing this entire operation. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've identified a direct connection - the Oceanus City Council member issuing directives is regularly meeting with unmarked vessels at night. They're exchanging what appear to be data drives and financial documents. I've photographed three such exchanges.\n\ntext_clean_clepper &lt;- connected_node_content_clepper %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(content)) %&gt;%\n  summarise(full_text = paste(content, collapse = \" \")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(full_text = str_to_lower(full_text),\n         full_text = str_replace_all(full_text, \"[^a-z\\\\s]\", \"\"),\n         full_text = str_squish(full_text))\n\nname_freq_clepper &lt;- tibble(name = people, clean_name = people_clean) %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(freq = str_count(text_clean_clepper$full_text, fixed(clean_name))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(freq))\ndatatable(name_freq_clepper)\n\n\n\n\n\nClepper Jensen frequently communicate to Miranda on Rodriquez, Conservation Vessels, Sam, V.

The unauthorized drilling equipment and bypassed environmental protocols are exactly what we need. Tomorrow's 5AM departure is critical - be in position early with telephoto lens equipment. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. Vessel activity has increased overnight. They've loaded what appears to be specialized deep-sea drilling equipment with restricted classification markings. Harbor security has doubled and they're checking IDs of anyone approaching the docks. Miranda, Clepper here. The increased security and restricted equipment confirms our suspicions. Document everything - especially those classification markings. Try to capture any conversations about Nemo Reef operations. This story is bigger than we thought. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've documented a new development - Neptune vessel arrived with what appears to be specialized submersible equipment. They're coordinating with the primary vessel crew, mentioning 'extraction points' at Nemo Reef. Security protocols have intensified further. Miranda, Clepper here. This Neptune arrival is significant. Document all submersible equipment transfers and capture any mention of 'extraction points.' These specialized vessels converging suggests major unauthorized operations. Keep monitoring and stay undetected. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. New development - I've observed conservation vessels 'Reef Guardian' and 'EcoVigil' increasing patrols near the harbor. They appear to be documenting the Neptune vessel and equipment transfers. Potential allies or monitoring presence? Miranda, Clepper here. Interesting development with conservation vessels. These could be valuable allies - approach them carefully if possible. Document any interaction between them and Neptune crew. This could reveal whether environmental authorities are aware of the operation. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've observed direct communication between conservation vessels and harbor security. They're exchanging documents and photographing equipment. Conservation teams appear to have official clearance documents I couldn't see clearly. Should I attempt closer surveillance? Miranda, Clepper here. Your observation about conservation vessels and harbor security is concerning. Do NOT approach them directly - too risky. Instead, use telephoto equipment to document their document exchange. This confirms official involvement we need to expose. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've managed to photograph the classification markings on the equipment - they're labeled 'Project Poseidon: Resource Extraction Phase'. The conservation vessels appear to be conducting legitimate environmental surveys, but they're being restricted from certain areas. Miranda, Clepper here. 'Project Poseidon: Resource Extraction Phase' is our smoking gun. Conservation vessels conducting legitimate surveys while being restricted confirms our theory. This is resource exploitation disguised as security measures. Continue documenting restricted zones. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've identified a pattern - conservation vessels are being systematically blocked from areas where 'Project Poseidon' equipment is deployed. Harbor security personnel are using falsified environmental clearance documents to justify restrictions. Miranda, Clepper here. Your discovery about falsified documents is crucial evidence. Focus now on identifying which officials are authorizing these restrictions. Look for signature patterns and document all security personnel involved. This could expose the entire operation chain. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've noted conservation vessels are documenting the falsified clearance documents. They seem unaware of their fraudulent nature. Should I attempt to anonymously alert them about Project Poseidon's true purpose? Miranda, Clepper here. No, don't alert conservation vessels yet - we need more evidence first. Their documentation of falsified clearances is valuable. Instead, track which officials are signing off on these restrictions. This creates plausible deniability for higher-ups we need to identify. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've observed harbor security personnel receiving directives from someone with 'Oceanus City Council' credentials. They're systematically updating restricted zone parameters after each conservation vessel report. This suggests council-level involvement in the cover-up. Miranda, Clepper here. Council-level involvement confirms our suspicions. Follow the paper trail between these officials and Project Poseidon. Document meeting times, locations, and any financial transactions. We're getting close to exposing this entire operation. Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've identified a direct connection - the Oceanus City Council member issuing directives is regularly meeting with unmarked vessels at night. They're exchanging what appear to be data drives and financial documents. I've photographed three such exchanges.\n\ntext_clean_miranda &lt;- connected_node_content_miranda %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(content)) %&gt;%\n  summarise(full_text = paste(content, collapse = \" \")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(full_text = str_to_lower(full_text),\n         full_text = str_replace_all(full_text, \"[^a-z\\\\s]\", \"\"),\n         full_text = str_squish(full_text))\n\nname_freq_miranda &lt;- tibble(name = people, clean_name = people_clean) %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(freq = str_count(text_clean_miranda$full_text, fixed(clean_name))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(freq))\ndatatable(name_freq_miranda)\n\n\n\n\n\nMiranda Jordan frequently communicate to Clepper on Rodriquez, Conservation Vessels, Sam, V.

Just spotted a pod of dolphins near the eastern point this morning. They were so playful! If you're free this weekend, the migratory birds are starting to arrive too. Let me know if you want to join for some birdwatching! Hey The Lookout, The Intern here! I'd absolutely love to join you for birdwatching this weekend! Those dolphins sound amazing. What time were you thinking? I'll bring my new binoculars that Mrs. Money helped me pick out. Mrs. Money, it's The Intern. Just checking in to see what tasks you need help with today. Also, I'll be birdwatching with The Lookout this weekend. Should I reschedule if you need me for anything? Mrs. Money, it's The Intern. I wanted to follow up on my earlier message about any tasks you need help with today. Also, The Lookout mentioned spotting sea turtles near Nemo Reef. Should we be aware of any conservation concerns there? Intern, it's Mrs. Money. Yes, we're aware of conservation concerns at Nemo Reef. Those sea turtle sightings are precisely why we need careful financial planning. I'll need you to compile some public conservation reports for our records. Intern, Mrs. Money here. Focus specifically on turtle migration patterns and protected breeding grounds in the Nemo Reef conservation reports. Also gather any information about current protection zone boundaries and recent enforcement actions. This is critical for our meeting tomorrow. Hey The Lookout, The Intern here! Just finished gathering those conservation reports for Mrs. Money. Looking forward to our birdwatching tomorrow at 7 AM. Quick question - how close were those sea turtles to shore when you spotted them? Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Just spotted a pair of ospreys building a nest near the lighthouse. Perfect timing for our birdwatching tomorrow! Also, those conservation boats seem extra active around Nemo Reef today. Wonder what's going on? Mrs. Money, The Intern here. I've noticed increased conservation boat activity around Nemo Reef that The Lookout just reported. Could this affect our plans? Should I gather information on these enforcement operations for tomorrow's meeting? Intern, Mrs. Money here. Yes, the increased conservation activity is concerning. Please gather intel on patrol schedules and enforcement jurisdiction limits. We need to understand their operational patterns before our meeting. This may affect our timing. Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. I've started gathering intel on patrol schedules and jurisdiction limits as requested. Conservation vessels seem to be following a tighter pattern around Nemo Reef's eastern boundary. Will have full report for tomorrow's meeting. Mrs. Money, The Intern here. The Lookout reports Mako approaching Nemo Reef with conservation vessels following. This seems connected to the increased activity we discussed. Should I investigate this specific incident for tomorrow's meeting? Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Very strange - harbor patrol just announced a permit for Nemo Reef was suddenly approved. Seeing unusual activity with special documentation and access corridors being set up. What's going on with your conservation work? Mrs. Money, The Intern here. The Lookout reports a Nemo Reef permit was suddenly approved with special access corridors being established. This explains the Mako sighting. Should I investigate who pushed this permit through? Seems highly unusual. Intern, Mrs. Money here. Investigate who approved the Nemo Reef permit immediately. This unexpected development could either compromise or benefit our operations. Check if V. Miesel's shipping lanes intersect with these new access corridors. Report back through secure channel only. Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! I asked around the harbor office - permit was signed by someone named Jensen from the City Council yesterday. They're establishing a corridor for the Mako vessel specifically. Something feels off about this whole situation. Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. Jensen from City Council signed the Nemo Reef permit yesterday. They're creating a corridor specifically for Mako vessel. Checking if this overlaps with V. Miesel shipping lanes as requested. Will have full report tomorrow. The Lookout, it's The Intern. Yes for birdwatching at 7am. I'm really interested in these 'fragile' crates and Neptune's arrival. Could you get photos of the equipment if possible? Might help connect some dots. Mrs. Money, The Intern here. Lookout provided photos of the fragile crates at harbor. Neptune's using unusual loading equipment. V. Miesel shipping lanes appear to overlap with new Mako corridors by 40%. Will bring full documentation to our meeting. Hi The Intern, it's The Lookout! Just got back from the harbor - those Neptune folks are working all night. Heard them mention 'underwater foundation work' at Nemo Reef. Brought my special binoculars for our birdwatching tomorrow! Mrs. Money, The Intern checking in. Neptune's crew mentioned 'underwater foundation work' at Nemo Reef during night operations. This seems beyond standard equipment installation. Should I investigate further or focus on V. Miesel overlap documentation for our meeting? Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Found something interesting while checking those crates - they're using specialized underwater concrete forms. Harbor master mentioned 'deep water construction' several times. I'll bring the photos tomorrow. Still meeting at the usual spot? Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. The Lookout discovered specialized underwater concrete forms in those fragile crates. Harbor master mentioned 'deep water construction' multiple times. This suggests permanent structures at Nemo Reef, beyond equipment installation. How should I proceed? Mrs. Money, The Intern here. Just confirmed with The Lookout - we're dealing with permanent underwater construction at Nemo Reef. Could this be related to V. Miesel's shipping lane expansion? Should I prioritize this information for our meeting? Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Harbor master just announced Nemo Reef closing in three days for 'environmental assessment.' Conservation vessels are suspicious - they're planning increased surveillance. Want to join our morning watch tomorrow? The Lookout, it's The Intern. Count me in for morning watch tomorrow. This reef closure timing seems suspicious with the concrete forms discovery. Should we bring specialized equipment for underwater documentation? The Intern, Mrs. Money here. Confirm our 0500 meeting at Nemo Reef is still secure. Need you to compile all evidence of concrete structures and V. Miesel's shipping expansion plans. Stay vigilant and report any unusual harbor activity. Mrs. Money, The Intern confirming our 0500 meeting at Nemo Reef. I've compiled evidence of concrete structures and V. Miesel's expansion plans. Will be joining The Lookout for morning watch to document underwater activities. Harbor still shows unusual movement. Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Just spotted some conservation volunteers setting up what looks like camera equipment at three points around Nemo Reef. They seem concerned about the closure. Still bringing those waterproof bags tomorrow? The Lookout, it's The Intern here. All set for 0700. I've got my underwater camera and extra memory cards. Should we document those conservation volunteers' camera placements too? Might help us understand their monitoring strategy. Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Just saw two conservation vessels anchoring north of Nemo Reef. They're using sonar equipment and taking water samples. Perfect day for birdwatching too - spotted a rare osprey! Still on for tomorrow? Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. Conservation vessels are anchored north of Nemo Reef using sonar equipment and taking water samples. I'll document their activities during morning watch with The Lookout. Still confirmed for our 0500 meeting. The Intern, Mrs. Money here. Need detailed photographic evidence of V. Miesel's structures before our 0500 meeting. Compile financial projections for their expansion. I'm meeting their management at 10AM tomorrow - need leverage. The Lookout, it's The Intern. I'll be there for our birdwatching session tomorrow. Excited about those shearwaters! I've packed my underwater camera too - might catch some dolphin footage if we're lucky. Conservation activity updates? Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. Conservation vessels have deployed underwater microphones around Nemo Reef. I've compiled all financial projections and photographic evidence as requested. Will arrive at our 0500 meeting with complete documentation. Anything else needed urgently? The Intern here, Lookout. I'm packed for our 7AM birdwatching. Have you noticed any unusual vessel movements during dawn hours? I'll bring coffee and those specialty binoculars Mrs. Money lent me. Excited about those shearwaters! The Lookout here, Intern! Just spotted those conservation vessels moving equipment to the eastern side of Nemo Reef. Perfect morning for our birdwatching! I've brought my special spotting scope - those shearwaters should be visible from our usual spot. See you at 7! Mrs. Money, The Intern here. I'll bring special binoculars to our 0500 meeting. The Lookout reports conservation vessels moving equipment to eastern Nemo Reef. Should I conduct reconnaissance before our meeting? All documentation ready as requested. The Lookout checking in, Intern! Just spotted the conservation vessels deploying drones with cameras over Nemo Reef. They seem determined! Perfect weather for our birdwatching tomorrow though. I've packed extra snacks for our early start! The Intern here, Lookout. Noticed the conservation drones during my morning run. Will bring my camera with telephoto lens to our birdwatching. Do you think those drones will disturb our shearwater watching? I'll arrive at 6:45 to set up. The Lookout here, Intern! The conservation drones shouldn't disturb our shearwater watching - they're focusing on the reef area. I've spotted a rare peregrine falcon this morning too! 6:45 works perfectly, I'll bring my field guide.\n\ntext_clean_intern &lt;- connected_node_content_intern %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(content)) %&gt;%\n  summarise(full_text = paste(content, collapse = \" \")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(full_text = str_to_lower(full_text),\n         full_text = str_replace_all(full_text, \"[^a-z\\\\s]\", \"\"),\n         full_text = str_squish(full_text))\n\nname_freq_intern &lt;- tibble(name = people, clean_name = people_clean) %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(freq = str_count(text_clean_intern$full_text, fixed(clean_name))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(freq))\ndatatable(name_freq_intern)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Intern frequently talk about or communicate to the Lookout, Mrs. Money on Conservation Vessels, and V.

Magnificent creatures! Don't forget about our birdwatching trip tomorrow at 7 AM. The weather looks perfect for spotting those migratory species! Hey The Lookout, The Intern here! Just finished gathering those conservation reports for Mrs. Money. Looking forward to our birdwatching tomorrow at 7 AM. Quick question - how close were those sea turtles to shore when you spotted them? The Lookout here! Those sea turtles were pretty close to shore, maybe 50 yards out from Nemo Reef. Unusual to see them so close! Don't forget your sunscreen tomorrow - forecast says it'll be bright. See you at Sunrise Point! Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Just spotted a pair of ospreys building a nest near the lighthouse. Perfect timing for our birdwatching tomorrow! Also, those conservation boats seem extra active around Nemo Reef today. Wonder what's going on? Sentinel, this is The Lookout. Acknowledged increased patrol needs around Nemo Reef. Have spotted three vessels lingering near southern boundary markers today. Will maintain position and continue surveillance. Can you confirm your current coordinates? Sentinel, The Lookout here. Observed suspicious tourism vessel approaching Nemo Reef's southern boundary - appears to be the 'Mariner's Dream'. They've made three passes near the restricted markers in the last hour. What's your position? Can you intercept? The Lookout here! Something odd at Nemo Reef - just spotted the Mako vessel approaching the protected area with conservation boats following them. Didn't they mention this was off-limits? Still on for birdwatching tomorrow? I've packed extra snacks! Sentinel, The Lookout here. Tracking tourism vessel approaching Nemo Reef from northwest quadrant. Appears to be operating without proper lights. Can you verify if they have permits? Will maintain surveillance from my position. Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Very strange - harbor patrol just announced a permit for Nemo Reef was suddenly approved. Seeing unusual activity with special documentation and access corridors being set up. What's going on with your conservation work? Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! I asked around the harbor office - permit was signed by someone named Jensen from the City Council yesterday. They're establishing a corridor for the Mako vessel specifically.

Several large crates marked 'fragile' being prepared. Seems like Neptune vessel is scheduled for arrival. Still on for birdwatching at 7 AM? The Lookout, it's The Intern. Yes for birdwatching at 7am. I'm really interested in these 'fragile' crates and Neptune's arrival. Could you get photos of the equipment if possible? Might help connect some dots. Hi The Intern, it's The Lookout! Just got back from the harbor - those Neptune folks are working all night. Heard them mention 'underwater foundation work' at Nemo Reef. Brought my special binoculars for our birdwatching tomorrow! Horizon, The Lookout here. Tracking unusually high vessel traffic near Nemo Reef today - counted 8 tourism vessels and 12 logistics boats in the last 4 hours. What's your observation from your position? Green Guardians, The Lookout reporting. Vessel traffic analysis complete - documented 23 logistics vessels and 14 tourism boats at Nemo Reef today, triple normal volume. Large equipment transfers observed. Continuing night surveillance as requested. Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Found something interesting while checking those crates - they're using specialized underwater concrete forms. Harbor master mentioned 'deep water construction' several times. I'll bring the photos tomorrow. Still meeting at the usual spot? Green Guardians, The Lookout reporting. Urgent update: Horizon confirms 15 logistics vessels with industrial equipment at Nemo Reef. Total count now 23 logistics, 14 tourism vessels. This activity contradicts environmental closure justification. Requesting immediate investigation. Hey The Intern, it's The Lookout! Harbor master just announced Nemo Reef closing in three days for 'environmental assessment.' Conservation vessels are suspicious - they're planning increased surveillance. Want to join our morning watch tomorrow? The Lookout, it's The Intern. Count me in for morning watch tomorrow. This reef closure timing seems suspicious with the concrete forms discovery.

Let's discuss this during our 3PM meeting along with funding allocations. Middleman, it's Mrs. Money. I've prepared those financial projections we discussed. Particularly interested in your thoughts on that Nemo Reef loophole before my meeting with Boss tomorrow. Available to talk this evening? Mrs. Money, this is The Middleman. I can meet this evening to discuss the Nemo Reef loophole before your meeting with Boss. Council just flagged increased vessel activity there - perfect timing for our plans. 7PM at the cafe? The Middleman, it's Mrs. Money. 7PM at the cafe works perfectly. I'll bring those financial projections on the Nemo Reef opportunity. I've also identified potential funding sources that won't raise flags with regulators. Mrs. Money, it's The Intern. I wanted to follow up on my earlier message about any tasks you need help with today. Also, The Lookout mentioned spotting sea turtles near Nemo Reef. Should we be aware of any conservation concerns there? Intern, it's Mrs. Money. Yes, we're aware of conservation concerns at Nemo Reef. Those sea turtle sightings are precisely why we need careful financial planning. I'll need you to compile some public conservation reports for our records. Intern, Mrs. Money here. Focus specifically on turtle migration patterns and protected breeding grounds in the Nemo Reef conservation reports. Also gather any information about current protection zone boundaries and recent enforcement actions. This is critical for our meeting tomorrow. Boss, it's Mrs. Money. I'm meeting The Middleman at 7PM tonight to discuss the Nemo Reef loophole. I've prepared financial projections and identified discreet funding sources. The Intern is compiling conservation reports focusing on protection boundaries. Mrs. Money, The Intern here. I've noticed increased conservation boat activity around Nemo Reef that The Lookout just reported. Could this affect our plans? Should I gather information on these enforcement operations for tomorrow's meeting? Intern, Mrs. Money here. Yes, the increased conservation activity is concerning. Please gather intel on patrol schedules and enforcement jurisdiction limits. We need to understand their operational patterns before our meeting. This may affect our timing. Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. I've started gathering intel on patrol schedules and jurisdiction limits as requested. Conservation vessels seem to be following a tighter pattern around Nemo Reef's eastern boundary. Will have full report for tomorrow's meeting. Middleman, it's Mrs. Money. Conservation patrol activity has increased significantly around Nemo Reef. We may need to adjust our approach for tonight's meeting. I've identified alternative funding channels if needed. Still on for 7PM? Mrs. Money, The Intern here. The Lookout reports Mako approaching Nemo Reef with conservation vessels following. This seems connected to the increased activity we discussed. Should I investigate this specific incident for tomorrow's meeting? Boss, Mrs. Money here. The Mako situation is escalating - conservation vessels are tracking it near Nemo Reef. The Intern reports unusual activity that could compromise our operation. Should we activate contingency plan or proceed as scheduled? Mrs. Money, this is Boss. Abort all Nemo Reef operations immediately. Conservation vessels are too active in the area. Implement contingency plan B - redirect funds through secondary channels and have The Intern destroy any documentation linking us to Mako's activities. Middleman, Mrs. Money here. Meeting cancelled. Boss has ordered contingency plan B due to excessive conservation activity at Nemo Reef. Destroy all documentation. Will contact you through secure channel with new instructions. Mrs. Money, this is Middleman. I've redirected Council's attention to other areas. Meeting with Boss tonight at 9PM to discuss new focus. Have you secured those alternative funding channels you mentioned? Need status update. Boss, Mrs. Money here. Alternative funding channels secured through V. Miesel Shipping. I've erased our financial trail to Nemo Reef operations and implemented full contingency protocols. Will attend your 9PM meeting with The Middleman to discuss next steps. Mrs. Money, The Intern here. The Lookout reports a Nemo Reef permit was suddenly approved with special access corridors being established. This explains the Mako sighting. Should I investigate who pushed this permit through? Seems highly unusual. Mrs. Money, Boss here. Need you to verify all financial trails are properly disguised through the tourism ventures. Destroy any documentation linking us to Nemo Reef operations. City Council is asking questions. Meet me at the usual spot tonight. This is Mrs. Money. Need immediate confirmation that our recent financial arrangements remain secure and untraceable. Conservation activity has increased around Nemo Reef. Require alternate routing options for future transactions. Respond only through encrypted channels. Mrs. Money, V. Miesel Shipping here. Financial arrangements remain secure. Have implemented new routing protocols through our southern operations. Encrypted verification codes forthcoming. Be advised, unexpected permit approval for Nemo Reef may present new opportunities. Intern, Mrs. Money here. Investigate who approved the Nemo Reef permit immediately. This unexpected development could either compromise or benefit our operations. Check if V. Miesel's shipping lanes intersect with these new access corridors. Report back through secure channel only. Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. Jensen from City Council signed the Nemo Reef permit yesterday. They're creating a corridor specifically for Mako vessel. Checking if this overlaps with V. Miesel shipping lanes as requested. Will have full report tomorrow. Boss, Mrs. Money here. Jensen from City Council approved the Nemo Reef permit. The Intern confirms special corridor creation for Mako vessel. This could interfere with our V. Miesel shipping arrangements. Recommend reassessing tonight's strategy at 9PM meeting. Mrs. Money, The Intern here. Lookout provided photos of the fragile crates at harbor. Neptune's using unusual loading equipment. V. Miesel shipping lanes appear to overlap with new Mako corridors by 40%. Will bring full documentation to our meeting. Neptune, this is Mrs. Money. Confirmed for 0500 tomorrow. Will coordinate payment protocols with Mako and Remora captains. Your eastern reef route is approved - it avoids the new permit zones. Bring encryption devices for financial transfers. Mako, Mrs. Money here. My role is financial controller for this operation - I'll be handling payment distribution, equipment funding, and resource allocation. Will bring encryption protocols and transfer devices. Eastern reef route documentation prepared for your review. Mrs. Money, The Intern checking in. Neptune's crew mentioned 'underwater foundation work' at Nemo Reef during night operations. This seems beyond standard equipment installation. Should I investigate further or focus on V. Miesel overlap documentation for our meeting? Remora, Mrs. Money here. Will be at Nemo Reef 0500 tomorrow to establish payment protocols with you and Mako. Bring documentation for specialized equipment. I'll handle all financial transfers and resource allocation for the operation. Rodriguez, Remora here. Need you on deck at 0500 tomorrow for special equipment handling at Nemo Reef. Mrs. Money will be present for payment protocols. Bring your technical certification documents. Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. The Lookout discovered specialized underwater concrete forms in those fragile crates. Harbor master mentioned 'deep water construction' multiple times. This suggests permanent structures at Nemo Reef, beyond equipment installation. How should I proceed? Neptune, Mrs. Money here. Funding approved for modified stabilization gear. Sam discovered specialized concrete forms suggesting permanent structures. Need clarification on actual scope before finalizing payment protocols tomorrow. Concrete structures weren't in original plan. Mrs. Money, The Intern here. Just confirmed with The Lookout - we're dealing with permanent underwater construction at Nemo Reef. Could this be related to V. Miesel's shipping lane expansion? Should I prioritize this information for our meeting? Mrs. Money, The Intern confirming our 0500 meeting at Nemo Reef. I've compiled evidence of concrete structures and V. Miesel's expansion plans. Will be joining The Lookout for morning watch to document underwater activities. Harbor still shows unusual movement. Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. Conservation vessels are anchored north of Nemo Reef using sonar equipment and taking water samples. I'll document their activities during morning watch with The Lookout. Still confirmed for our 0500 meeting. The Intern, Mrs. Money here. Need detailed photographic evidence of V. Miesel's structures before our 0500 meeting. Compile financial projections for their expansion. I'm meeting their management at 10AM tomorrow - need leverage. Mrs. Money, The Intern reporting. Conservation vessels have deployed underwater microphones around Nemo Reef. I've compiled all financial projections and photographic evidence as requested. Will arrive at our 0500 meeting with complete documentation. Anything else needed urgently? Mrs. Money, The Intern here. I'll bring special binoculars to our 0500 meeting. The Lookout reports conservation vessels moving equipment to eastern Nemo Reef. Should I conduct reconnaissance before our meeting?
